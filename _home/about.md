I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, University of Michigan. I am advised by Prof. Mark W. Newman. I also collaborate with Dr. Joyce Lee and Prof. Matthew Kay. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, and Personal Health Informatics. Currently, I am studying the use of personal health data by patients and clinicians to design data visualizations and sense-making tools that can augment human cognition to lower the burden of continuously and frequently interacting with data.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I completed a Master's from the University of California Irvine where I learned how to be an ethnographer. Even before that (in a past life), I worked as a software developer at Goldman Sachs after completing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT BHU, Varanasi, India. A true explorer at heart, I am passionate about posing questions that matter and finding answers to them. Here is my CV.
