<p style="font-size: 18pt; font-style: bold;">About Me</p>

Hi there! I am Shriti. I am an Assistant Professor at Stanford University in the Department of Medicine Center for Biomedical Informatics Research and the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
<br>
<br>
I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher with a primary focus on healthcare. I examine ways in which self-monitoring data is used or could be used by patients with chronic conditions and their clinicians to facilitate the care of chronic health conditions. I conceptualize, design, and evaluate novel tools and approaches to leverage personal health data towards the vision of enabling data-driven care. My research draws from the fields of human-computer interaction, information visualization, clinical-decision support, personal informatics, and chronic illness management to raise novel research questions that cut across disciplines. My work has been published in top Human-Computer Interaction venues including ACM CHI, IMWUT, and CSCW.
<br>
<br>
I have been fortunate to attend several Universities. I completed my Ph.D. from the Univerity of Michigan where I was supervised by Prof. Mark Newman. Prior to that, I got my master's from UC Irvine where I worked with Prof. Yunan Chen. I completed a bachelor's in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU in India.

If you're interested in working with me or discussing health tech, higher education, HCI research, motherhood, dogs and food, feel free to reach out!
