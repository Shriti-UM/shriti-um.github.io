<p style="font-size: 18pt; font-style: bold;">About Me</p>
Hi there! I am Shriti. I am an Assistant Professor at San Francisco State University in the Department of Computer Science. I completed my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan's School of Information.  
<br>
I am a Human-Computer Interaction and a Health Informatics researcher. I examine ways in which self-monitoring data is used or could be used by patients with chronic conditions and their clinicians to facilitate the care of chronic health conditions. I conceptualize, design, and evaluate novel tools and approaches to leverage personal health data towards the vision of enabling data-driven care. My research draws from the fields of human-computer interaction, sensemaking, information visualization, medicine, chronic illness management, personal informatics, and health decision-support to raise novel research questions that cut across disciplines.  
<br>
To answer interdisciplinary research questions, I use a combination of qualitative methods that include interviews, observations, focus groups, visualization-based think aloud sessions, task-driven visualization review, and user-centered design and evaluation. My work has been published in top Human-Computer Interaction venues including ACM CHI, IMWUT, and CSCW.
